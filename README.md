## Rails Flow!

### Data Brick
1. Generate your models
2. Add association and validations
3. Populate our DB -> seeds (if needed!)

### Applicative Brick
1. Route
2. Controller action
3. View

In order to progress we code one user story at a time
1. As a vistor I can see details about one park ✅
2. As a visitor I can add animals into a park (create an animal) ✅
3. As a visitor I can set an animal free (delete from the park)
